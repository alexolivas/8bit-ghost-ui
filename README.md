# 8Bit Ghost UI

This project extrapolates only the necessary components required to build the themes used for my personal and prototype projects so that I only care about project's content and not their UI. This allows for faster prototyping without having to worry about theme-ing.

This project is built based on the free version of the [Black Dashboard React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/black-dashboard-react/#/admin/dashboard) theme built by Creative Tim.
